# Aura Clip — Week 1 Development Report  
**Course:** Project & Portfolio IV  
**Student:** Arianna Miller-Paul  

---

## Project Overview
Aura Clip is a desktop AI-assisted highlight generator for streamers and video editors.  
Its purpose is to **automatically detect scenes**, **let users select the best moments**, and **export clips** without manual timeline scrubbing.  
The project is built with **Python 3.11**, **PyQt 6**, **PySceneDetect**, **MoviePy**, and **FFmpeg**.

## Project Status
| Phase | Goal | Status |
|-------|------|--------|
| **Research & Development** | Build a proof-of-concept showing import --> detect --> export flow with placeholder UI. | COMPLETE |
| **Iteration 1 Build** | Strengthen the prototype into a usable demo with empirical data and improved export naming. | COMPLETE |

## Research & Development Phase 

### Objectives
- Establish project structure and core dependencies.  
- Verify PyQt 6 GUI launches correctly.  
- Implement **Import**, **Detect Scenes**, and **Export Clips** actions end-to-end.  
- Log user interactions and confirm that each feature works on a sample video.  
- Produce a short R&D video explaining design choices.

---

## Iteration 1 Build 

### Objectives
Focus only on **unique user-value features** and **measurable performance**:  
- Maintain the import --> detect --> select --> export pipeline.  
- Add **empirical data** (timings, counts, success metrics).  
- Rename exported clips to reflect the **actual scene numbers** shown in-app.  
- Prevent UI freeze during long operations.  
- Record the **Iteration 1 Showcase Video** proving the complete workflow.
